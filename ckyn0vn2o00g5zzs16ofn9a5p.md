## 5 Things I've Learned Since Making the Switch to Web3.0.

**Cryptocurrency** and blockchain technology had a bumpy start for me.

Before I ever typed a single piece of HTML code, this happened to me. During difficult times, I stumbled across a get-rich-quick scam that offered returns to those who deposited a small amount of money.

These "coin-brokers" vanished as quickly as they appeared after I made my initial deposit.

It would be easy to assume that this tragic event would be the end of my adventure as a blockchain novice, but it was just the beginning.

Even though it wasn't a lot of money, the 18-year-old in me felt compelled to learn more about this new trend.

Before I started buying coins, I looked into the market, the technology, and how they could be used, so I knew what to do.

About two months down the road, a friend showed me the ropes of HTML and CSS.

I can't tell you everything about my two-year journey to becoming a blockchain developer.

Prior to diving into Solidity, I specialized in full-stack JavaScript development.

My friends and mentors in the blockchain field stoked my desire to begin my career as a blockchain engineer.

Before long, I'd learned several important things about this industry and how it works.

Let's get right down to it.


### 1.  The blockchain ecosystem is nascent.
In 2015, Ethereum became the first cryptocurrency to implement [smart contracts](https://blog.michaelasiedu.com/the-lifecycle-and-application-of-blockchain-smart-contracts).

There are no restrictions on who can use the Ethereum platform to build long-term and immutable decentralized applications that can be accessed by anybody.

In this case, the programming languages and other basics that developers use to make DApps are still very new and change a lot.

If you study outdated materials, you'll be doing more harm than good.

Let's have a look at the Solidity programming language.

Semantic Versioning is the versioning model used by Solidity. The Solidity Team released 0.8.11 on December 20, 2021, which is the current version.

Based on [this information,](https://blog.soliditylang.org/category/releases/) it's clear that new versions are released on average once each month.

A solidity release announcement was made on January 2, 2020, for Solidity 0.6.1.

Backward compatibility will be added in version 0.8.11, which is scheduled for release in January 2022.

A similar study may be conducted on other important technologies being employed in the development of blockchain-based applications.

When it comes to learning resources and tutorials, I do my best not to ingest data from resources that are more than a year old.

There are always new and old features being added and taken away. To get the most out of the ecosystem, developers need to be prepared to constantly reinvent themselves.

New resources should be consumed by developers who seek to reach the market.

Documentation is the best resource for learning about new technology. Every time a new feature is added or an old one is taken away, that material is changed.

This [link](https://blog.soliditylang.org/category/releases/)will keep you updated on Solidity's release schedule.




### 2.  The top 1% know JavaScript.

DApps are constructed with JavaScript and associated libraries. JavaScript is used to create a user-friendly UI for smart contract systems.

User-interface communication with smart contracts is required. The most popular and flexible libraries for this interaction are web3.js and ethers.js, both written in JavaScript.

Using these libraries requires JavaScript knowledge.

But JavaScript's narrative isn't over. Local smart contract development using Truffle and Hardhat uses JavaScript for configuration and testing. You may see this in action when you upload your DApp source code to Github.


### 3.  It's a rewarding experience to learn Solidity.

It was based on JavaScript, but Solidity is very different from JavaScript in terms of how it works.

Solidity is a compiled language that can't be executed directly, which is a fine line to draw between the two.

The EVM requires a compiled version of Solidity to understand it, but JavaScript can be run natively.

The brilliance of JavaScript's type and variable declarations makes it an ideal starting point for learning Solidity.

Static typing means that the types of variables are known at compile time in Solidity.

A variable's type must be expressly declared if it is to be of the type `uint` or `address`  before it can be used in a statement.

Setters are recorded as transactions in Solidity, which is an intriguing concept.
 

### 4. There are a lot of better options out there, and they don't always have to be six-figure positions.

"6-figure job" is a safe bet when you hear about Web 3.0 these days. In no time at all, I saw that the Web3 ecosystem had a lot of promise and offered a wide range of possibilities.

When it comes to blockchain development, there is no such thing as a bad bet.

Freelancing, starting your own NFT projects, building a DeFi ecosystem, and writing content are just a few of the options.

During the first month of my web3 courses, I received more job offers and e-mails than when I was a full-time web programmer.

While a six-figure salary is great, I believe there are better possibilities to juggle when you know how to create blockchain-based applications.

### 5.  You're filled with confidence and a sense of purpose.

Upon studying the Cryptopunks NFT code, and realizing that I was among the 1% of individuals who could perform it, I felt like I'd accomplished something significant.

The NFT marketplaces and eCommerce stores are examples of the work I've done.

During this early stage of the industry's development, I find it very exciting to be one of the few people who can understand the technical parts that everyone else is so excited about.

What I mean is, how many individuals can read and understand the Uniswap v3 source code?

The value and demand for blockchain engineers are likely to rise rapidly in the next several years.

This is the best sensation I've ever had.


### Conclusion.

The road to becoming a blockchain developer has been long and arduous thus far. In the short time I've been working with blockchain, I can certainly state that it has been one of the most rewarding and risky decisions I've ever made.

Thank you for staying with me so far. Thank you, and I'll see you soon.
