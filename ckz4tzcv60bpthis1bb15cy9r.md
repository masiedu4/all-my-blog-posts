# 5 Tips to Make You a 1%er Software Developer

### Introduction

Achieving mastery in any field is difficult in this day and age when there is a seemingly endless supply of information available for the taking.

In my opinion, learning to code should be made easier through the education system and learning channels.


To what end are we unable to make the lives of our students "easy" despite the fact that it appears so? With some work and a return to the roots, I'm confident the present and future generations of learners will benefit greatly.

The subject matter of this article is not "Data Structures and Algorithms." When it comes to judging a developer's technical aptitude, I tend to write down the basics.

Everything I've written here is based on my own personal experience and the advice of some of the most brilliant engineers I've had the pleasure of meeting.

Make sure you've mastered the five essential principles of software development, regardless of your domain.  ↓ 


### 1. Constantly Reinvent Yourself 

Although many people shudder at the prospect, programming is a life-long endeavor. You never stop learning as long as you are not retired or dead. In order to become a versatile developer, you must overcome your own ego.

I've found that the finest programmers are open-minded and willing to adjust things if they don't work out for them.

"Knowing it all" is the best way to become obsolete as a developer.

To put it simply, a **know-it-all** dismisses other people's opinions, remarks, and suggestions with arrogance.

Disruption is inherent in the very nature of technology. Our old stacks are always being re-examined and deprecated when new technology or software comes out that is a big change.

Being stuck in an industry like this for more than a year is impossible. You must be able to move quickly, shield yourself, and adjust to any significant change that may come your way.

There has been a lot of attention paid to software development in recent years, but when put into perspective, it's mind-boggling.

Technology doesn't care about your "feeling". Is the addition of a new stack going to help you along the way? It's time to learn!

**In order to be current, you must continually re-invent yourself.**


### 2. Read code more  

Regardless of how skeptical I am of the idea of reading more code than you write, the debate is worth the time.

The two most fundamental laws that I've learned about reading and sharing ideas are directly related to my strong desire to do both.

Writing is a way to keep track of what you've learned. Reading is a great way to discover new things.

Exposure is the goal of reading other people's codes.

You'll be amazed at how much a short amount of exposure can improve your skills.

If you've ever worked on a project with more than one developer, you know that the variety of coding styles can be intimidating. 
However, if you're lucky enough to work with talented programmers, you'll be pushed to learn a lot in a short period of time.

That's what you get when you read other people's codes!

You're putting your brain through a fair amount of stress by attempting to read something written by someone else. As a result, you'll have a better grasp of how other successful engineers think.

If you're willing to put in the effort, you'll gain new problem-solving skills in the process. Polymaths rise to the top because they have a natural aptitude for a wide range of subjects.

**Those who can read and write are the most intelligent. You won't be regarded as a regular if you do both!**



### 3. Connect and learn from the best

Leaving the room when you are the smartest person in the room is the smartest decision, in my opinion.

**If you want to be considered a member of the 1%, you must be in the 0.999 percent.**

When it comes to networking, the possibilities are virtually limitless.

In addition to improving your social well-being, networking can lead to the interchange of new ideas and concepts. When you meet people from many walks of life, your professional self-confidence will soar, and you'll learn a great deal.

There has never been a better time to connect, network, and learn than right now.

Join a group of like-minded people who are eager to learn and share their experiences, participate in hackathons, and apply for positions that are a little outside of your comfort zone in order to push yourself.

Be a part of the best and push yourself!



### 4. Fundamentals first , tools later

It's common for people to dismiss the idea that knowing fundamental arithmetic is better than learning the entire calculus syllabus.

No building can be constructed without the use of wood. The sort of wood needed for any project is essential knowledge for a builder.

I'll use two of my all-time favorite people's quotes to help illustrate my point.

> In the words of Naval Ravikant: **Start from the bottom up and "think clearly from the ground up.**" 

>"In my opinion, first principles are more significant than analogies. In our daily lives, we use analogies to make sense of the world. When we employ an analogy, we're doing something because it's similar to something else that's been done or something that other people are doing. You start with the most fundamental realities and then work your way up from there", Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors

Each and every tool or framework has been developed from the ground up and should be used in the same way.

JavaScript is used to build React.js. A JavaScript developer should be well trained in order to construct React apps.

To begin with, you must have a basic understanding of how computers process and interpret data.

The mastery of one basic paves the path for the mastery of another.

An organ like the brain's anatomy can be used as an example.

It is the neurons, the brain's basic cells, that serve as the brain's structural foundation.

These neurotic cells convey information from one part of the brain to another via synapses in the spinal cord, which students learn about in a brain anatomy lesson.



### 5. Take your time | Conclusion

Our brains are terrible at multitasking, according to scientific research. That's why it's so important to be able to narrow down your interests and focus.

The best way to learn is to focus on one subject at a time. 

Keep going until you can explain something to a 5-year-old and then move on.


TL: DR?

1. Constantly reinvent yourself
2. Read code more 
3. Connect and learn from the best
4. Fundamentals first, tools later
5. Take your time 


I'm glad you enjoyed this. **Take your time but move as fast as you can! **.
